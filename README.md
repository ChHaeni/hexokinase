# hexokinase

## Todo list

1. Handle utf-8 using unicode/utf-8. This package doesn't seem to have the functionality I need so I may need to write one myself to have a function which is the equivalent of `strings.Index`
2. rename a lot
3. handle flags
4. adjust public api
5. sort the color by ColStart before printing.
